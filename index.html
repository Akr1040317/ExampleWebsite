                        Due to unforeseen circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, for the safety of all participants, we have collectively decided to postpone all future events until further notice. Because our events involve a lot of interaction between instructors and students alike, our team feels that it is in everyone best interests to continue supporting this cause from the safety of their own homes. We have decided instead to help raise awareness to the benefits of bowling through writing articles and opinion pieces. If you are interested in this writing opportunity and hope to get some of your work featured, get a hold of us with the contact info at the bottom of this page! We hope to educate our audience with these stories, and build a strong base before we can start holding in-person events.

                        Our team is committed to sharing the benefits of bowling with everyone. We hope to instill a passion in the younger generation that fuels a lifetime of success. Sports have proven to be a fundamental part of growing up. It teaches responsibility, perseverance, and teamwork. We believe that everyone deserves a chance to explore the wonders of bowling. That's why we will host events (free of charge) for underprivileged children to reap the benefits of being part of a community.

                        We are looking for venues that could hold our events of about 15 kids and 2-3 instructors.

                        As a fledgling organization, we hope to reach as many children as possible. By outreaching through schools and social media, we hope to reach our desired crowd. Once times have gotten back to normal, we hope to start holding events at local bowling alleys. These events will have professional coaches ready to help the kids learn all the techniques and nifty tricks that will help them become seasoned bowlers in no time! Unfortunately, these events will require money donated by good people like YOU! When the time comes, we hope you can support our goal by donating and sharing this website with friends and family.
